# Future developments 
- One future development is to have a meet up page where users can arrange a spot to meet up and book a place. There will be an interactive map feature and bookings form. This is the build on the community they have found through the bird spotting page. 

- Another feature development is to add a react-bootstrap carosel on the home page. This will add to user experience and the overall look of the website. 

- I would also like to add a likes feature so that the users can like eachothers posts. 

- Another future development is to create the profiles page where a user can update and delete thier profile.

# Deployment 
- ElephantSQL
I created a new instance on ElephantSQL and copied the API key into the env.py file. 

- Heroku
To deploy to Heroku I logged into my accound and created a new app. In Settings I clicked deploy. I then connected this to my gitpod repository and set the config vars. I then deployed mmy branch and run the app.

- React 
To create the react app I set up a frontend folder within my project. In the frontend folder I installed react using the npx create-react-app command. 
After all the packages were installed I ran the npm start command.
