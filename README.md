# Future developments 
- One future development is to have a meet up page where users can arrange a spot to meet up and book a place. There will be an interactive map feature and bookings form. This is the build on the community they have found through the bird spotting page. 

- Another future development is for the user to vote for their favorite bird picture. They can click on the picture and award it one point. Users will be able to see how many votes each bird has. The winner will have their bird picture displayed on the main page.

# Deployment 
- ElephantSQL
I created a new instance on ElephantSQL and copied the API key into the env.py file. 

- Heroku
To deploy to Heroku I logged into my accound and created a new app. In Settings I clicked deploy. I then connected this to my gitpod repository and set the config vars. I then deployed mmy branch and run the app.

- React 
To create the react app I set up a frontend folder within my project. In the frontend folder I installed react using the npx create-react-app command. 
After all the packages were installed I ran the npm start command.
